# Inemuri Sur Alarm App 

## Description
Developed in 2023, "Inemuri Sur Alarm App" is a university project made during the third course of Computer Engineering at UC3M.

It was made for the subject "Interactive and Ubiquitous Systems" and corresponds to one of the practices of this course. The main goal of the project is to learn how to use **APIs** (in this case the Google Maps API) using **JavaScript** programming language. It also requires knowledge about **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** oriented to mobile phones and the use of certain functionalities like the **GPS** and the **vibration**.

**NOTE:** The code and comments are in spanish.

## Installation
No special instalation is required for this code to work.

## Usage
This program is designed to be used in a mobile device. To test it, you will need an Android device connected to the computer with the code and the same WIFI network.

The program must be run in localhost and accessed from the phone through Google Chrome using the URL http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html. "5500" is the port used as an example and can be changed if the code is running in another one.

## Problem Proposed
"Inemuri" is a Japanese term that refers to short naps taken by people during the day. These naps often occur while commuting, particularly on trains or buses.

The goal of this app is to assist those who want to sleep during their commute on the Madrid Metro, specifically targeting users of line 12.

The app uses the phone’s GPS to continuously track the user’s location. After selecting the stop where they want to wake up and pressing "Confirmar," the app will trigger the phone to vibrate when the user enters a predefined radius around their stop, alerting them that it's time to prepare to exit the train.
